# Factorial Calculator
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number.

The functions takes a number, for example `5`. It then calculates the factorial of `5`, which is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`. The calculated value of the factorial is then printed to the console.

## Instructions
- Declare a variable called `factorial` and initialize it to 1.
- Create a for loop that starts at 1 and ends at the given number.
- Inside the loop, multiply the current value of factorial by the current loop iteration value.
- After the loop, print out the factorial variable.

## Example Output
```
The factorial of 5 is 120.
